                        <li class="Answer">You will be given a card to buy amazon items with which we will also track for security reasons, and then you ship your items out to us, once we've sold it we pay you a cut of the profit. It doesnt cost you anything to buy the items.</li>

                            <li class="Answer">As part of the method you can only purchase one item at a time, which means the more people we have buying items simultaneously the more money we can make at any given time.</li>
